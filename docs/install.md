# Install and upgrade

Relaynet Pong is distributed as a Helm chart. Note that deploying the Docker images directly is discouraged: We're likely to change paths, as well as split and rename the Docker image.

## Example

At a minimum, you have to specify the Vault authentication token; e.g.:

```
helm repo add relaycorp https://h.cfcr.io/relaycorp/public

helm install \
  --set vault.token=the-secret-token \
  pong-test \
  relaycorp/relaynet-pong
```

Check out [`relaycorp/relaynet-pong-chart`](https://github.com/relaycorp/relaynet-pong-chart/tree/master/example) for a working example on Google Cloud Platform.
